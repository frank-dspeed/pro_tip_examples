dpkg command cheat sheet for Debian/Ubuntu Linux



dpkg is package manager for Debian Linux which is use to install/manage individual packages. 
Realy often People mess with it they simply delet package parts and then this manager don't works any more then you need to fix that or manual remove the package

Here is quick cheat sheet you will find handy while using dpkg at shell prompt:
Syntax 	Description 	Example
dpkg -i {.deb package} 	Install the package 	dpkg -i zip_2.31-3_i386.deb
dpkg -i {.deb package} 	Upgrade package if it is installed else install a fresh copy of package 	dpkg -i zip_2.31-3_i386.deb
dpkg -R {Directory-name} 	Install all packages recursively from directory 	dpkg -R /tmp/downloads
dpkg -r {package} 	Remove/Delete an installed package except configuration files 	dpkg -r zip
dpkg -P {package} 	Remove/Delete everything including configuration files 	dpkg -P apache-perl
dpkg -l 	List all installed packages, along with package version and short description 	dpkg -l
dokg -l | less
dpkg -l '*apache*'
dpkg -l | grep -i 'sudo'
dpkg -l {package} 	List individual installed packages, along with package version and short description 	dpkg -l apache-perl
dpkg -L {package} 	Find out files are provided by the installed package i.e. list where files were installed 	dpkg -L apache-perl
dpkg -L perl
dpkg -c {.Deb package} 	List files provided (or owned) by the package i.e. List all files inside debian .deb package file, very useful to find where files would be installed 	dpkg -c dc_1.06-19_i386.deb
dpkg -S {/path/to/file} 	Find what package owns the file i.e. find out what package does file belong 	dpkg -S /bin/netstat
dpkg -S /sbin/ippool
dpkg -p {package} 	Display details about package package group, version, maintainer, Architecture, display depends packages, description etc 	dpkg -p lsof
dpkg -s {package} | grep Status 	Find out if Debian package is installed or not (status) 	dpkg -s lsof | grep Status

{package} - Replace with actual package name 


Some other Real Live Examples

Test if package exists with the apt-cache
is_installed=0
test_installed=( `apt-cache policy package-name | grep "Installed:" ` )
[ ! "${test_installed[1]}" == "(none)" ] && is_installed=1

Test if package exists with the good old query :D
dpkg-query -Wf'${db:Status-abbrev}' package-name 2>/dev/null | grep -q '^i'

Will return true (exit status 0 in shell script) if the package is installed, false (exit status 1) otherwise.

    -W means "Show" (dpkg-query must have a requested action).
    -f changes the format of the output.
    db:Status-abbrev is the short form of the package status.
    2>/dev/null silences dpkg-query if an invalid package name is given. How this should be handled could be a case-to-case issue.
    grep -q returns true if there is a match, false otherwise.

If it is used often, it could be made a simple function:

#!/bin/sh
debInst()
{
    dpkg-query -Wf'${db:Status-abbrev}' "${1}" 2>/dev/null | grep -q '^i'
}

if debInst "${1}"; then
    printf 'Why yes, the package %s _is_ installed!\n' "${1}"
else
    printf 'I regret to inform you that the package %s is not currently installed.\n' "${1}"
fi

or just simply

#!/bin/sh
if dpkg-query -Wf'${db:Status-abbrev}' "${1}" 2>/dev/null | grep -q '^i'; then
    printf 'Why yes, the package "%s" _is_ installed!\n' "${1}"
else
    printf 'I regret to inform you that the package "%s" is not currently installed.\n' "${1}"
fi
